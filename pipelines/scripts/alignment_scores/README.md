# Alignment Scores

This pipeline takes a source and a target (together with their index cache files) and the target config file as input. If the target config file requests that the target be compared with a particular source, the pipeline trains a Fast Align model. For each verse, each source and target that are aligned are recorded in `alignment_scores.csv`, together with the alignment score and a count of how many times they are aligned throughout the corpus.
