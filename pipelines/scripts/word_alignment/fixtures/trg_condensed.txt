in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day
